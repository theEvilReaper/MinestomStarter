## MinestomStarter

This project is a simple application designed to start a Minestom (Microtus) server with specified variables.

Currently, the application only accepts the `server.host` and `server.port` variables via environment variables.

> [!CAUTION]
> The project may support additional variables in the future.  
> My time is currently limited, and which variables are added will depend on the context.
